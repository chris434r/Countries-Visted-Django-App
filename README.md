# Countries-Visted-Django-App

Work in progress Django web app built using Leaflet/Mapbox as front end and postgres as backend. 

Goal is to replicate scratch map posters - which are a popular way of showing which country you have visted.

In this app the user can click on the map or search for the country in a search box.

On selecting the country, the corresponding flag is shown on a side panel, which is using the Country Flags API: https://www.countryflags.io/
